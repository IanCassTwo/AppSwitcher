# App Switcher

This is a simple app that I wrote for [my Android tablet install](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fozZnyctdl8&t=1s) in my car. It allows you to switch between certain apps in a circular fashion using a steering wheel button controlled by [Joycon](http://www.rcjoycon.com/cpjexr/)

To make this work as expected, please program a button to send "Windows key + M" which Android normally uses to launch the default mapping application. I've programmed this app to trap the launch attempt & to trigger loading of the next app.

To select which apps it switches between, load the app & use the options menu to choose your apps.
